RightAPI

RightAPI.rb is supposed to be a feature parity wrapper for the RightScale API.  It has become a bit too timeconsuming to keep it in-sync with the production API so I've ceased work on this.

RightAPILite.rb
A simple API wrapper that allows you to send/receive API calls easily.  You need to handle formatting the API string properly with object ID's & the proper resource but it should do the rest.
